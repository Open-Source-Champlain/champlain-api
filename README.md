# Champlain API

## Explanation:
Currently there is no centralized API to access Champlain College's data. A centralized API would provide easy access to this data. This enables developers and students to build solutions that improve campus experiences.


## Objectives: 
- Create a centralized API: This project should create a centralized API where information can be accessed. Public users, students, and faculty should be able to use the API.
- Offer a scalable solution: The API should be designed so that future integrations and endpoints can be easily added.


# Installation
This project uses Swagger to host API endpoint documentation.
